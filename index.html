      <p>There are a lot of stigmas, myths and misconceptions surrounding menstruation and menstrual products. Thatâ€™s why we decided to create a website to provide resources, guides, information and a supportive environment  for women, young girls and people who have periods to learn more about themselves and their bodies.
