                  Menstrual cups are one of the best sustainable period products out there. They are small, flexible, reusalble bell-shaped cups that are typically made from silicone. You insert it into the vagina to collect period blood rather than absorb it (like tampons). Depending on the brand, you can leave them in for up to 12 hours, then you can empty! It's great for swimming and if you don't want to change out products frequently during the day! Just an example of a popular brand is the Saalt cup brand, they have a good sustainability mission and have saved their customers 259,951$ in menstrual product prices.<a href="https://saalt.com">Saalt cup</a>

            <div class="p2f" id="myDiv2" style="display:none;">Tampons are a product that absorbs blood during your period. Tampons are designed to be inserted into the vagina with or without an applicator. Tampons are also one-use which means they should only be used 1 time.
            Here is a tampon myth below:
            1. Tampons can get lost inside you: FALSE. A tampon can go higher in your vagina, and the string might get tucked away, but itâ€™s not lost forever, itâ€™s in there. This is because the cervix is a barrier between your vagina and uterus so essentially, the vagina is the dead end.

              Period underwear can be a little expensive but after you own them, they last a while. Often times, period panties have been underrated as a period product but they are super useful. How they work is you put them on like normal underwear, and then when you change them most comapanies direction are to just throw them in the washing machine. Here is a popular brand that have a good mission for inclusivity. They also have a brand that has more affordable prices for teens.

            <div class="p4f" id="myDiv4" style="display:none;">
             Pads are one the most comfortable and popular products. What are pads? Well, pads are usually rectangular piece of absorbant material that you stick on the inside of your underwear. Like tampons, they are single use only. How to use a pad? To use a pad, peel the plastic wrapping off and press it on to your underwear. Change the pad about every 3â€“4 hours, if your period is heavy, you can change your pad more often. Changing pads often can cut down on any odor.
             Also like tampons and menstrual cups, there are different sizes. About 60% of women don't know their true pad size, so make sure to get the size that best fits you.
