    <div class="n1"><p>I still remember the first time I got my period. I was 12 years old, my period lasted 4 days but they were the most painful 4 days of my life. As for now, I donâ€™t get very painful cramps (only on the first day). My periods have been regular, my cycle is about 29 days and I never had problems with it. Whatâ€™s your story?<b> ~ Sarah </b></p></div>
    <div class="n2"><p class="n22">I got my first period when I was 10 and even though my mother had already spoken to me about it I was really confused because I had been feeling super moody all week and thought i had an upset stomach the day I got it. But when I told my mother about this incident she told me what it really was. She and my grandmother then took me out for icecream and got me all of my favourite foods so that I could relax and be fully energized. We as women need to support eachother because we are all in the same boat and need to be there for eachother!<b> ~ Malaika </b></p></div>
    <div class="n3">
      <p class="n22">I got my first period at 13 and I have an irregular period. My period can last from 7 - 32 days. I heavy bleed a lot and sometimes I don't get my period for 1- 6 months. I went to the doctor and they said that I was perfectly fine, but that I might have PCOS. My period is definitely not the "average" period and I would go through a box of pads per cycle, but educating myself was super important so that I can stay sustainable and healthy as a person with an irregular period.<b> ~ Eri </b></p>

    <div class="n4"><p>i got my first period during a family trip to Rome when I was 13. I remember being scared about it, and kind of ashamed. I wouldnt tell my brother why i couldnt go swim with him, and he was very upset. Now, I try to talk about my period as openly as possible. It shouldnt be something girls should hide! #normalizeit <b> ~ lilja </b></p></div>
